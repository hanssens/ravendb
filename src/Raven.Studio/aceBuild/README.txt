Purpose of this mini project is option to customize ace editor w/o code duplication. 

We get ace editor using npm. File overrides are stored in addons dir. Ace source and addons are copied to build dir. Then we fire Makefile.dryice.js to build ace and output this to src\Raven.Studio\wwwroot\Content\ace.
